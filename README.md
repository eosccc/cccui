Introduction to CCC UI. 

In order to make it easier for more developers to develop chain games, we decided to open source the UI framework source code for Crypto Cycle games. Through this UI framework, you can interact with the EOS mainnet, obtain the chain data of the game contract, initiate the operation on the chain, and include the game UI main interface and so on. 



Note that open source does not include complete Crypto Cycle game code and resources, but is limited to basic UI material and JS scripts that interact with EOS mainnet.
